This is the Club Nerva Membership contract. The purpouse of this contract is for me to distribute NFTs to Club Nerva members. They can't be traded or transferable and only I can award this membership.

We're using standard openzepplin libraries

NFTs are only mintable by owner
Transfers and approvals are only allowed to be called by owner.
